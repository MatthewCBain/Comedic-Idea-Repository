# Stand-Up Comedy Routine: "Accessories, Instagram Boyfriends, and White Decor"

## Male Comedian Version (Seinfeld Style)

**Opening – Setup**  
What *is* the deal with women and accessories? Everything's an accessory! The shoes, the bag, the nails, the dog, the boyfriend! I didn’t know I was part of the *fall collection*—“This season, we’re pairing flannel with fragile masculinity.”

**Instagram Photographer Bit**  
You go to any scenic overlook now, there’s always some poor guy—backpack on, Nikon in hand, trying not to fall off a cliff—because he’s been promoted from boyfriend to full-time Instagram photographer.  
She’s doing five poses. Meanwhile, he’s sweating like he’s defusing a bomb.  
He didn’t come for the view—he *is* the view.

**Arm Candy / Lifestyle Shaping**  
Women really do see men as accessories. It’s like, “Can you just stand here and look tall but non-threatening?”  
I got asked if I could wear more earth tones—to “blend in with the aesthetic.” What am I, a sofa cushion?

**Interior Decorating + White Obsession**  
Everything has to be white. White walls, white cabinets, white baseboards.  
You walk into some of these homes—it’s like living inside a marshmallow.  
Can’t touch anything. It’s like a crime scene with throw pillows.

**White Car Bit**  
Even the *car* has to match the outfit.  
A guy buys a car based on what it can haul.  
Women buy a car based on whether it photographs well in front of Trader Joe’s.  
“It looks clean!”  
Yeah, for about four minutes.

**Bedazzling Bit**  
No man has ever said, “These jeans need rhinestones.”  
Men don’t bedazzle—we *duct tape.*

**Closer**  
So now I live in a white house, ride in a white car, I match the décor, and I’m not allowed to disagree with any of it.  
**I’m not a man—I’m a throw pillow that has to mute its opinion.**

**Encore Tag / Banter**  
(crowd glance)  
Some of you guys are nodding. You're like, “I'm currently accessorizing a woman through Home Depot.”  
Last weekend, I asked if we could go somewhere *I* wanted.  
She said, “Sure—but take a photo of me there first.”  
So now we’re hiking a mountain I didn’t choose, at 6 a.m., because the *lighting* is good.  
“Do I get a photo?”  
She says, “Why? You’re not really the vibe.”

## Female Comedian Version (Ali Wong / Taylor Tomlinson Style)

**Opening**  
Sometimes we treat men like accessories.  
But most of you showed up dressed like an unmotivated gym teacher, so yeah—I’m gonna edit. I’m not dating a man, I’m editing a *draft.*

**Instagram Boyfriend Bit**  
I love an Instagram boyfriend.  
He’s like a golden retriever with a camera. Loyal. Trainable. Slightly confused.  
He acts like I asked him to storm Normandy just to get a pic with brunch in focus.

**Home Decor / White Obsession**  
Yes, I want my house to look good.  
Sorry I’m not decorating like a medieval pub.  
White doesn’t scream, “I peaked in high school and now I’m building a man cave.” It screams, “I’ve moved on from Axe body spray.”

**White Car Bit**  
You think I picked a white car to match my outfit?  
No—it hides the scratches *he* put on it trying to “squeeze in” next to a mailbox.

**Bedazzling Bit**  
Yes, women invented bedazzling. You’re welcome.  
It’s called *flair.*  
Men? They’re out here patching things with duct tape like they’re building a canoe out of shame.

**Closer**  
So yeah, maybe he’s just an accessory.  
But he accessorizes *me.*  
If I have to choose between a man who matches my vibe and one who questions my throw pillows?  
**I'm going with the one who shuts up and holds the ring light.**
